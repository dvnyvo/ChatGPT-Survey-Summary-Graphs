This program runs through the command prompt.



To run this program you must first install the following packages:

	1. If you have python and not PIP (package manager) installed, type in command prompt
		"python get-pip.py" OR "pip install pip"
		 https://pypi.org/project/pip/	  <-- Website for PIP installation


	2.Once PIP is installed type the following package installation commands:
		 pip install openpyxl
  		 pip install pandas
  		 pip install matplotlib
  		 pip install windows-curses


In this program, in a single file, it creates functions that prints different types of graphs for each question.

At the bottom of the code asks the user if they want to print all graphs now or use the interactive menu (command prompt only)




To run this program:
			(WINDOWS)
		-> head to folder location 
		-> in address bar on top (ex. D:\Documents\VSCODE\python\CPS412)
		-> type 'cmd' to open command prompt in that directory

			If that doesn't work try:
			-> Open command prompt in your window's search
			-> If your file is in a different drive enter your drive name followed by ':' (ex. D:)
			-> Set up the directory by typing 'cd ' followed by name of next folder
			-> Repeat the 'cd nextfoldername' process until you reach the target folder (CPS412)
		

		-> run the .py file by typing "python CPS412 Assignment.py" in cmd prompt
		-> A screen will appear with all the questions, navigate using UP and DOWN arrows
		-> Press Enter to select an option, a graph will appear, close it with 'X' top right
		-> To exit go to the last option and press 'QUIT'
