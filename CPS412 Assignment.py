#Students:  Danny Vo

#To install python's package manager if not installed yet, in command (assuming python is installed)
#type "python get-pip.py"
# OR  "pip install pip"

#  Then type in command prompt to install the following packages necessary for this program
#  pip install openpyxl
#  pip install pandas
#  pip install matplotlib
#  pip install windows-curses


#DESCRIPTION 

# Reads from excel sheet, for every question there is a function that prints their corresponding graph
# At the bottom of the code, if you decide not to use the interactive menu through the command prompt at the folder's directory
# You can display all graphs

# If user chooses interactive menu option in an IDE, it will cause an error. MUST be run through command prompt.
# To run the interactive menu please read the README.txt file for instructions to run the .py file from command prompt and navigate the interactive menu
